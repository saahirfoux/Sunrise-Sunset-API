What I would've added / done differently

### `What I would've added`

<ul>
    <li>Form field validation</li>
    <li>Timezone Correction</li>
    <li>Fully functional NPM package ready for use in any application</li>
</ul>

### `What I would've done differently`

<ul>
    <li>In one of my early iterations of the project, I included a feature to remove a location once you clicked next. I encountered a bug, but in the interest of saving time, I disabled this code to focus on the other remaining requirements and user experience to finish.</li>
    <li>In my technical approach document I drafted in my notes I planned to create a highly re-usable component that could fit into any app, ready to be skinned / themed as desired, with certain options (like max locations) that could be passed in. I published the code to NPM, but some work remains. If I could invest more time, I would polish this approach and create a demo where you could run "npm install "xxxx"</li>
    <li>There are a few unit tests I would like to add for quality coverage.</li>
</ul>
